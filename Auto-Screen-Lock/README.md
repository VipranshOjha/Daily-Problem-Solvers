# 👀 Auto Screen Lock

Do you **forget to lock your computer** when you walk away for a snack, a call, or just because life happens?
**Auto Screen Lock** makes sure your files, chats, and secrets stay safe—by locking your screen automatically when you’re not  around.

---

## 🚩 What is this?

Auto Screen Lock is a Python application with a simple **GUI** that uses your webcam and **face recognition** to check if you’re still at your desk.
If you leave, it gives you a short grace period, then **locks your screen** using the system’s native lock.

---

## 🪄 Features

✅ **Face Recognition Based:** Uses your stored reference photo to verify it’s *you*.

✅ **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with OS-level lock commands.

✅ **Custom Timeout:** Choose how long the system waits before locking (default: `30s`).

✅ **Warning Mode:** Enable an optional last warning before the lock triggers.

✅ **GUI Controls:** Start/stop monitoring, adjust settings, run test camera/lock functions.

✅ **Activity Log:** Built-in log window tracks events (face detected, lock triggered, etc.).

✅ **Persistent Config:** Settings are saved to `screen_lock_config.json` and restored automatically.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VipranshOjha/Daily-Problem-Solvers.git
   cd Daily-Problem-Solvers/Auto-Screen-Lock
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Dependencies include:

   * `opencv-python`
   * `face_recognition`
   * `tkinter` (usually pre-installed with Python)
   * `dlib` (needed by `face_recognition`)

3. **Provide your face reference image:**
   Place a clear photo of yourself as `my_face.jpg` (or change the path in `main.py`).

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ How it works

* Continuously captures webcam frames.
* Compares detected faces with your saved reference image.
* **If your face is missing** for more than the timeout → screen locks.
* Face returns before timeout? Timer resets, you’re safe.
* All actions are logged in the app for transparency.

## 📝 Why I built this

Because I kept leaving my screen unlocked 😅 and returned to… “pranks” on Slack or worse, exposed docs.
This app fixes it—quietly, automatically, and cross-platform.
